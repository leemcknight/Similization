<p />

Resources are things in the earth that can be utilized, such as oil, coal, or gold.  Once resources are found, they can be taken advantage of.

<p />

Some resources will require you to mine the area before the resource is yours.  Others will only require road access.  Still others will only require it to be within your area of control.  To understand this better, it is important to understand the different types of resources.

<p />

There are three types of resources:
<li>Bonus</li>
<li>Luxury</li>
<li>Strategic</li>

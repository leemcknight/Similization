<p />

Over time, as your wisemen and scientists conduct research, your civilization will gain access to new technologies.  These technologies will allow you to build new units and city improvements.  Some technologies will allow you to take advantage of different natural resources.  

<p />

Since most new knowlege and research builds on past knowledge and research, as you learn new technologies, you will be able to research more new technologies.  For example, once you learn about religion, you might be able to research more advanced religions, such as monotheism.

<H2>Units</H2>

<p />

Units are the things that move around the map in Similization.  There are ground units, air units, and sea units.  Some units are non-militarisitic in nature, but most units are military units.

<p />

Units have different abilities.  Some units can settle new cities, some are used in a military, some are good at exploring, and others can build farms, mines, and other land improvements.  

<p />

As the game progresses in Similization and you learn new technologies and gain access to new resources, you will be able to produce stronger and more powerful units.  In some cases, older units can be upgraded to newer, better units (for a price, of course).

<p />

Units have rank status, indicating that they are newer units or veteran units.  Veteran units will perform better in all aspects.  They will have better defensive and offensive capabilities, and they will usually be able to travel longer distances easier.

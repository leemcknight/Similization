<H2>Rulesets</H2>

<p />
	A Ruleset is a group of rules that make up the entities, graphics, and properties of a Similization game.  Rulesets define which units, technologies, governments, etc... exist in a game, what properties they have, and how they relate to each other.  

<p />
Similization allows the user to create, modify, and copy rulesets as you see fit.  You can tweak existing rulesets to get the exact type of game you want to play, or use a ruleset that somebody else has created.

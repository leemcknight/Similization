<H2>Bonus Resources</H2>

<p />

Bonus resources are resources that can be used simply by controlling the square.  Bonus resources affect the production of a square on the map.  To take advantage of a bonus resource, a city must be working the square that the resource is on.

<p />

Unlike strategic resources, bonus resources are always available during the game, regardless of which technologies you have acquired.
